## What is RoboPad?

"RoboPad" is the collective name for the RoboPad firmware and the Robo66 hardware, which when working together form a simple-to-use and cheap remote control system for combat robotics.
RoboPad offers an affordable entrance to the world of combat robotics, allowing you to simply connect motors directly to the control board and remote control your robot from your phone, without the need of an expensive radio transmitter controller or the wiring-in of reciever electronics.

## How can I get one?
The roboPad firmware is ESP8266-compatable, and if you are interested in having a small form-factor board contact [@Blayzeing](https://www.twitter.com/Blayzeing/) or drop us an email at roboPad@blayze.tech.
Alternatively, you can use the schematics here to build your own robo66 board to run RoboPad on - having said that, if you're confident constructing your own board, you may want to instead look at more traditional R/C control electronics which will probably have a better performance profile.
