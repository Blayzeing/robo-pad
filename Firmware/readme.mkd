Firmware
========

This folder contains firmware code for RoboPad, each is it's own Arduino project folder. However, as in the long run each firmware variant will be generated by the precompiler on a per-robot basis this folder will serve more as a repository of single robot configurations.

This folder also contains the robopad core, which should be placed in the `Arduino Libraries` folder so all projects can access common code.
